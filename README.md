# Rankings-UI

This is a ranking UI that can visualize a CSV file that contains the reviews and rankings from multiple reviewers to multiple proposals.

Run the main.py file and then type in the CSV file name without any punctuation.

TO DO's

* create Review_box class and give it attributes. 
* write a function that takes ratings and maps them to attributes.  e.g. FQ --> frame width
* edit the input csv file, and make sure that OP is consistent with the rankings. (i.e. if OP(Chipotle) > OP( Xi'an) then Chipotle is higher ranked than Xi'an.
* now we want the rankings to look less like a table, so control the box width to leave some space between columns.
* and now plot the y values of the proposals in each ranking according to both the rating and the ranking.
