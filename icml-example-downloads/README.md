Reviews.xls
------------
Excel file with all reviews for the selected papers. Ordered by paper id. 
Q1, Q2, Q9 are free text (the review summary and the full review, questions for authors).
The other Q's are multiple choice; the choices can be found in the review form.
I have deleted some fields and did not fill them with dummy data (e.g. reviewer names and emails).
